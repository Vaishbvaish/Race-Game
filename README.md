## Project Overview
 The Race Game simulates a racing experience where players control a car on a race track using computer graphics techniques.The game features basic animations, collision detection, and dynamic updates to create a smooth and fun racing experience.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++/Java/Python (or specify the language you used)
- Graphics Library: OpenGL/SDL/pygame (or specify the graphics library used)
- IDE: Visual Studio/Code::Blocks/IntelliJ (or specify the IDE used)
- Other Libraries: GLUT, FreeGLUT (for OpenGL), etc.

## Features
- Real-time car movement on a racing track.
- Dynamic display of race progress and speed.
- Collision detection with obstacles.
- Scoreboard and timing system.
- Simple yet engaging graphics using 2D/3D models.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Vaishbvaish/Race-Game/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file
cd race-game

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all the necessary libraries and dependencies installed for the project to run.

- For OpenGL:
 - Install GLUT/ FreeGLUT for window management.
 - Install GLEW for OpenGL extensions (if applicable).
- For pygame (if you're using Python):
 -You can install it using pip:
    pip install pygame
3. Setup the Environment
If you're using a specific IDE or build system, ensure the project is configured properly.
For example:
- For C++ using g++ (with OpenGL):
   g++ -o racegame main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
- For Python using pygame:
  - Make sure you have pygame installed and then run the game script:
      python race_game.py
4. Run the Game
Once everything is set up, run the project:
  # For C++ (in terminal):
    ./racegame

  # For Python:
    python race_game.py
This will launch the game window where you can start playing.

## Controls
- Arrow Keys: Move the car left or right.
- Up Arrow: Increase speed.
- Down Arrow: Decrease speed.
- Spacebar: Pause/Unpause the game.
- Esc: Exit the game.

## Installation
  1.Prerequisites:
   - Ensure you have the necessary compiler or interpreter for the chosen language (C++ compiler, Python interpreter, etc.).
   - Install required libraries (OpenGL, pygame, etc.).
  2.Clone the Repository:
     https://github.com/Vaishbvaish/Race-Game/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file
       cd race-game
  3.Run the Setup: Follow the setup instructions in the "How to Use" section based on your development environment.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement multiplayer mode for competitive racing.
- Add power-ups and special abilities (e.g., speed boosts).
- Improve graphics by adding textures or 3D models.
- Implement different racing tracks with varying difficulties.
- Add sound effects and background music for a more immersive experience.
